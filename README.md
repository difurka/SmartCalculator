# SmartCalculator

A calculator that counts ordinary functions and draws their graphs.

This project implements an extended version of the standard C++ calculator. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as addition/subtraction and multiplication/division, the calculator is enhanced with the ability to evaluate arithmetic expressions in sequential order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.) of expressions, it also supports the use of the variable x and plotting the corresponding function.
